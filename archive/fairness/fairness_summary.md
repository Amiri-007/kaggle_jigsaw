# Fairness Metrics Summary for DistilBERT Toxicity Classifier

## Overview

We've analyzed the fairness metrics for our DistilBERT-based toxicity classifier. This model was trained on a subset of the Jigsaw toxicity classification dataset using a simplified training pipeline with the original architecture but optimized for faster training.

## Overall Performance

- **Overall AUC**: 0.953
- **Best performing demographic group**: atheist (AUC: 0.959)
- **Worst performing demographic group**: female (AUC: 0.956)

## Key Observations

1. The overall model performance is strong with an AUC of 0.953.

2. There is relatively small variance between demographic groups:
   - AUC range: 0.956 - 0.959 (difference of only 0.003)
   - This indicates good fairness across different identity groups

3. Background Positive, Subgroup Negative (BPSN) and Background Negative, Subgroup Positive (BNSP) metrics:
   - BPSN AUC values range from 0.955 to 0.959
   - BNSP AUC values range from 0.932 to 0.938
   - Lower BNSP values suggest the model may have some bias in classifying toxic comments from identity groups

4. Representation in the validation set:
   - Most demographic groups are represented in approximately equal numbers
   - Each identity group has 14,000+ examples in the validation set

## Comparison to Other Models

The BERT-based model shows more stability across demographic groups compared to other models in the results directory:

- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression models show much higher variance between groups
- Our DistilBERT model has more consistent performance metrics across all demographic groups

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain the current architecture**: The DistilBERT model shows good fairness characteristics while being computationally efficient.

2. **Focus on the female demographic group**: Although the difference is small, the female group has slightly lower performance and could benefit from targeted improvements.

3. **Investigate BNSP scores**: The relatively lower BNSP scores across all groups suggest that the model still has some bias in how it classifies toxic content that mentions identity groups.

## Conclusion

The DistilBERT model provides a strong balance between performance, fairness, and computational efficiency. The small performance gap between demographic groups suggests the model is relatively fair, though there is still room for improvement in addressing bias for toxic content that mentions identity groups.
