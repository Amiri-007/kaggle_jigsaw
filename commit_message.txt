fix: repo cleanup + torch cpu pin + HF cache + guard placeholders + seeded dry-run

- Updated .gitignore to exclude auto-generated artifacts
- Created legacy/ directory and moved old Keras scripts there to avoid attrdict imports
- Verified torch==2.2.2+cpu pinning with correct PyTorch CPU index URL
- Verified HF_HOME cache configuration in GitHub workflow
- Added placeholder image generation to notebook guard for dry-run mode
- Verified that np.random.seed(42) is properly set in predict.py for dry-run
- Verified summary.tsv header safeguard is properly implemented

This ensures CI runs will be faster and more deterministic, making figures generation 
more reliable even in dry-run mode. Overall, these changes enable consistent CI testing
while keeping the entire RDS fairness audit system maintainable and reproducible.
